# Grocery in One
## About
- Grocery in One focuses on taking user input and cross-referencing it with gathered data to give grocery recommendations to avoid overbuying or underbuying

## Inspiration
- This project is inspired by a personal project I wanted to work on relating to health and  nutrition
- It attempts to tackle the cost of eating out and instead, make meals at home
- In addition, it focuses on reducing the time put into making grocery lists or wandering through stores trying to figure out which items to purchase

## Next Steps
- Fix some of the bugs
- Incorporate a frontend side with interactive parts
